## About

As a copywriter I've worked across a range of clients at a number of agencies in Melbourne including Cummins and Partners, M&C Saatchi, CHE Proximity and most recently, more than five years at The Royals.

My work's been recognized at various award shows including AWARD, Caples, MADC, ADMA, Spikes and the NineMSN Butterfly Awards.

Writing and storytelling are my passion, and when I'm not working on agency briefs, you'll find me at home working on my screenplay.
