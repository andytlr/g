## About

After an ill-advised detour into the exciting world of accounting, I chose to leave the glamour of spreadsheets behind and instead devote my energies to the much more serious world of advertising.As a copywriter I've worked across a range of clients at a number of agencies in Melbourne including Cummins and Partners, M&C Saatchi and most recently The Royals.My work's been recognized at various award shows including AWARD, Caples, MADC, ADMA, Spikes and the highly sought after NineMSN Butterfly Awards.
