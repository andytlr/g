Every time I walk into The Forum, the first thing that comes to mind is what an awesome place this would be to do shrooms. Not only is the interior trippy as balls; the sound is second to none.

So for a band who are invariably described as orchestral, cinematic, sweeping or all three at once, I doubt the organisers could have picked a better venue.

After pushing my way through enough moustaches to populate several dozen seventies pornos, I made my way to a prime position close to both the stage and the bar, just in time for the lights to drop to near darkness and the band to walk on.

It was then that something happened that I’ve never experienced before – all conversation in the crowd suddenly stopped, and apart from a few excited woops and yelps, everything was silence.

Following the band on is the 23-piece orchestra, filling the space usually reserved for speaker stacks and drummers. Seating themselves, they wait quietly, facing the conductor off to one side, holding their instruments in polite readiness as the anticipation builds.

The first beats of a xylophone bring loud appreciation from the crowd, in direct contrast to the quiet swell of the music.

The lights build, slowly revealing the front of the stage for the very first time but leaving the orchestra in shadow. 

Everyone in the band is seated, heads down, faces screened from the crowd by thick curtains of dark hair. The only exception is the bass player who stands swaying in the centre.

The music continues to lift and lift, then drops suddenly, lifts then drops, lifts then drops, like The Pixies played by John Barry or Ennio Morricone.

The crowd listens in rapt silence. They’re transfixed. The atmosphere and tension would be almost perfect if it wasn’t for the loud jarring sound of empty beer bottles occasionally being tossed into recycling bins.

There’s a quiet intensity to the music; with the shadowy, synchronised movements of the orchestra, like waves rising and crashing, providing a fitting visual.I’ve never seen an audience give a band such complete attention before. 

Then a funny thing happens, I start to notice, first one couple then more, throughout the crowd beginning to hold each other a little closer. Hands stroking backs, lips reaching up to peck cheeks, fingers softly stroking hair. No one’s wrestling tongues or groping body parts. This is altogether quieter, more intimate – just like the music.

This isn’t music to fuck to; it’s music to get in the mood to fuck to.

Maybe it’s around here that I start reaching for superlatives. Orchestral, cinematic and sweeping have already been taken. Words like expansive, emotive, visceral and glorious come to mind but none of them do it justice. In fact they all sound kind of lame in comparison.

It isn’t until the end that my girlfriend turns to me and sums the whole experience up perfectly simply with the words -- ‘So fucking good’.
