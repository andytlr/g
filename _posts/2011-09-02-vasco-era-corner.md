Arriving at Richmond station, the place was a wall-to-wall with sullen, post match footy fans. From the dead eyes and grim scowls it was clear someone had lost, and badly.

By the time we managed to push our way through the sports ball horde and make it to The Corner, the last support band were just finishing up and the room was filling fast.

Heading straight to the bar, it was balls deep in a pretty fair cross section of the crowd – garage nerds, older rock pigs and young hipsters, all of them standing between me and a beer.

Still, we managed to make it to the bar and back into the crowd with a tasty beverage just in time for the stage curtains to open to a storm of raucous hoots and applause from a clearly pumped up crowd.

Without any hesitation the band launches straight into their first song.

Sid, the singer, hunched over his guitar, face turned up to the microphone, belts out that distinctive nasal, whiskey and cigarettes rasp from behind a screen of hair. And within moments a small, but enthusiastic hedge of fingers erupts from the crowd and begins to stab the air in time to the music.

The finger pointing then builds into a mini tsunami of overhead hand clapping. I look around and see friends smile and nod to one another and girls dancing and singing along in excited little knots. And the band hadn’t even finished their first song yet.

It’s hard to believe, but each successive song draws an even more enthusiastic response from the crowd than the last.

By the third, we see our first stage diver. By the fourth, guys at the back are dancing, and even the die-hards at the bar have forgotten about the booze for a moment and are giving the band their full attention.

The songs are pain and joy in equal amounts, but you can get that from the albums. What you don’t get is the energy and confidence that washes off the band and bounces back from the crowd – it’s blistering, dangerous and unsteady, but exhilarating at the same time.

They play “Child Bearing Hips’, the first single from their new album, but they don’t make a big deal about it. Now the audience is a sea of pumping fists; stage divers rise and fall across their shoulders like it’s the Nineties all over again.

More new songs follow. One, ‘Rock and Roll Is All That Makes Me Feel Good’ sounds like the bastard child of The Modern Lovers and AC/DC, while another - the new, slow song that Sid encourages everyone to get a drink for, sounds like Pavement on smackie pills.

The gig ends with several members of the supporting bands getting up on stage to join in on a cover of Dylan’s ‘Like a Rolling Stone’. It’s a messy, drunken kiss goodbye that has the whole crowd singing along. It’s also here that my good friend Randy turned to me and said ‘Dylan hasn’t sounded this raucous since he was a speed addict’. Which, for me, pretty much sums up the whole gig.

At one point, Ted, the bass player points out that Collingwood had lost that night by 96 points. That would explain the horde of sullen losers at the train station. But tonight, at The Corner, everyone went home a winner.
