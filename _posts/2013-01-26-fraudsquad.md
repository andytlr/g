ANZ, one of Australia’s biggest banks, asked us to develop an online campaign to launch their Fraud Money Back Guarantee. The guarantee promises that if your account details are stolen and used fraudulently, the bank will refund any loss.

### The solution

With very little differentiation in the product offerings between the major banks, we wanted something that would stand out from the typical Photoshopped executions that crowd the sector.

What better way to demonstrate the dangers of card theft than to show one being stolen -- literally out of the banner itself?

With everything created and shot live in studio, the resulting banners sit into the page itself, almost like a shelf, giving the impression that there’s an actual thief literally inside your computer.

### Results ###

* Click Through Rate 70% higher than the industry average of 0.04%
* Trial intention for day-to-day accounts 7% higher for consumers who recognised the campaign
* Brand image metrics increased by at least 10% above benchmark
