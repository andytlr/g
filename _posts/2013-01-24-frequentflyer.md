### Problem ###

Encourage people to open an ANZ Frequent Flyer credit card by promoting the benefit of receiving 16,000 bonus Qantas Frequent Flyer points.
			
### Solution ###

We created a page take over that, when clicked, gave people the experience of walking through New York. This was done using a video that allowed users to use their mouse to click and drag the image and rotate the view a full 360 degrees as it played.
