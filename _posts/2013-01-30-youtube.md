Beyond the latest cat video or kid on a skateboard, many users aren't aware of the sheer depth and quality of content on YouTube. We were tasked with increasing the amount of time people spend on site and improving perceptions of YouTube as a credible entertainment platform.

## Strategy & Execution ##

The most active audience on YouTube is music fans. So we created a campaign that spoke directly to them, using specially created original content and existing material from deep in the YouTube vaults. We secured a range of leading international artists to curate a series of YouTube playlists and personally introduce them.

## Results ##

In six months, the campaign generated:

* Views: 13.8 million
* 757,000 viewing hours of music-related content

What's more, favourability for YouTube is now 30% higher than other music video sources. The campaign has been so successful that itâ€™s now being rolled out into other content areas, including Get More Into Sport, featuring top Olympians and surfers.
