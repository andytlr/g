People have forgotten to look inside new devices before they buy them. Only to realise once they get them home that they may not be able to do everything they assumed they could, because the processor inside wasnâ€™t good enough. This campaign needed to remind people to take the time to look inside and increase consideration for Intel powered devices.

### Strategy ###

Demonstrate 'post-purchase-regret'. We wanted to help people understand the importance of looking inside before you buy, by learning from someone else's mistake.

### Solution ###

We created an interesting film that showed a frustrated and infuriated user unable to do what he needed to do -- a very common feeling when working with inferior technology. However, we gave the user the unique ability to rewind his decision and make good on his selection of device. He walked forwards, back in time. With the production company and talent we went to the painstaking lengths of shooting the talent walking backwards in a world that was moving forwards, then played the film backwards to viewers. This produced a really engaging and compelling film that delivered the message comprehensively and memorably for our client.

### Results ###

The various film lengths have been viewed over 2 million times on YouTube and Facebook. Consideration for the brand increased in the 4 weeks of the campaign by 28% and awareness of Intel and the need to look inside doubled.
