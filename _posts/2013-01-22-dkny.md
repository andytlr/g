### The Solution ###

DKNY is synonymous with New York and everyone knows that if you want to make it there you’ve got to be prepared to do whatever it takes. So we ask, just how far would you be prepared to go to make it there?

We get people to post a picture of themselves in their underwear as their profile image on Facebook together with the status “I’ve undressed for success with DKNY”. We then ask them to write a brief (140 characters or less) description of what they’d be prepared to do to get to New York.

The grand prize is a trip for 2 to New York to stay at the Chelsea Hotel and attend a Misshapes DJs celebrity party. There will also be daily prizes of DKNY clothes from the Fall Collection available to win. Entries to be judged according to the creativity of the photo and the description.
