## Go (Insane) Your Own Way ##

My love of seventies cocaine era Fleetwood Mac is well documented, but up until now my knowledge of the band’s early history, prior to Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham joining, was virtually nil.

I knew that they’d formed as some kind of blues band in the sixties and had had a couple of line up changes, but that was about it. Hating the blues, I was happy to leave it there. That is until I found this documentary about the band’s original leader, Peter Green. 

While the music for the most part is just as dull as I’d imagined it would be (at one point Peter is compared to the most boring guitarist on earth, Eric Clapton), the story of Peter and the band’s formation is not.

Without giving too much away, Peter wrote a bunch of really well known songs you’ll probably be surprised to learn were recorded by Fleetwood Mac, got famous, got almost rich, threw it all away and then went bat shit crazy. Along the way you get to see the metamorphosis of the band from a bunch of boring, weed smoking hippies into the coke-vacuuming juggernaut they became.
