**Show us yer tatts**

[Ozzie Osbourne has gone on record many, many times saying if you want to be different, or you want to be special – don’t get a tattoo](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1957475,00.html).

And he’s right. When every second dipshit sport star and soccer mum is proudly flaunting half and even full sleeves, you pretty much know that all the rebellion has been sucked out of that particular pastime. These days it’s right up there with wearing a bathing suit that reveals your knees -- it doesn’t even warrant a second look.

But it wasn’t always like that. Back in the day, tattoos were badass and being a tattooists was about as badass as it comes.

Anyone with even a passing interest in tattoos will be familiar with Sailor Jerry. This guy is one of _the_ big daddies of the scene. And it's no exaggeration to say the things he was doing in the forties, fifties and sixties is pretty much responsible for most of what's cool today.

But more than that, the guy was a stone cold loon who packed more adventure, travel and general fuckin’-shit-up into his 60-odd years than most people would fit into 60-odd lives.
